This project investigates how climate-related disasters impact labor market dynamics and economic stability in the United States. By integrating datasets from FEMA, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and climate change records, this analysis explores trends in employment, unemployment, and labor force participation before and after natural disasters.

To achieve this, we implement an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate data ingestion, transformation, and storage. The processed data is then analyzed through statistical summaries and visualizations to provide insights that can aid policymakers, businesses, and disaster recovery efforts.
